# Movie Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing movie data from various datasets to gain insights into the movie industry. It utilizes Python and popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib to explore and visualize the data.

## Datasets

The project utilizes the following datasets:

bom.movie_gross.csv.gz: Box Office Mojo movie gross data.
imdb.title.basics.csv.gz: IMDb movie basics data, including movie titles and genres.
imdb.title.ratings.csv.gz: IMDb movie ratings data, including average ratings and number of votes.
imdb.name.basics.csv.gz: IMDb person names and associated professions.
imdb.title.akas.csv.gz: IMDb movie alternate titles data.
imdb.title.crew.csv.gz: IMDb movie crew data, including directors and writers.
imdb.title.principals.csv.gz: IMDb movie principal cast data.
tmdb.movies.csv.gz: The Movie Database movie data.
tn.movie_budgets.csv.gz: Movie budget and revenue data.

## Code Files

The project consists of the following code files:

data_analysis.ipynb: Googloe Colab Notebook containing the code for data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
data_visualization.py: Python script for generating various plots and visualizations from the movie datasets.
helper_functions.py: Python script containing helper functions used in the data analysis process.


## Setup and Requirements

To run the code and replicate the analysis, follow these steps:

Clone the project repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
Install the required libraries by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Download the dataset files mentioned above and place them in the appropriate directory.
Update the file paths in the code files to match the location of the dataset files on your machine.
Run the code files in a Python environment or execute the Jupyter Notebook cells to perform the analysis and generate visualizations.
Note: It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage the project dependencies.

## Usage and Examples

The code files and Jupyter Notebook provide examples of how to load, clean, analyze, and visualize movie data from the datasets mentioned above. You can explore the code and modify it to suit your specific analysis requirements. The provided code snippets demonstrate techniques for data cleaning, data merging, and creating various visualizations such as bar plots and scatter plots.

## Results and Findings

The project aims to provide insights into the movie industry based on the analyzed data. By running the code and exploring the visualizations, you can gain an understanding of various factors such as movie budgets, ratings, genres, and cast member contributions. The visualizations can help identify trends, patterns, and relationships between different variables in the movie industry.
